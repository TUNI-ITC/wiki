# PhD Thesis
Below are very short instructions for the process and links to the corresponding university Web pages.

## Do research (years 1-4)
This is the most challenging part, but don't worry, your supervisor will tell you as that's his/her job! Below some links that you should check:

 - [A Survival Guide to a PhD by Andrej Karpahty](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/)
 - [How to do research by Bill Freeman](http://people.csail.mit.edu/billf/publications/How_To_Do_Research.pdf)
 - [Scientific article writing by Fredo Durand](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/FredoBadWriting.pdf)

## Start writing the thesis (year 4)
Your supervisor tells you that "Now its time!". What you need is a suitable template, Latex of course. One popular choice is the one by Ville Koljonen: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/zskzfgpnpjcz](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zskzfgpnpjcz)

Once you are done (make sure you do it well, check your spelling and grammar), you send a PDF to your supervisor(s) for review and comments. After they are happy to your thesis it is ready for pre-examination.

## Pre-examination 
Your supervisor selects two reviewers, makes sure they are available and fills the official form (see below).
You need to send the following two documents

 - The pre-examination form filled and submitted by your supervisor is available at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)
 - PhD thesis in PDF format and including the articles - make a single PDF and if its size >15MB you should resize your images before compiling the PDF

to the responsible person of your doctoral program. For the Doctoral program of Computing and Electrical Engineering (CEE) the responsible person and main information source is *elina.orava ät tuni.fi* who knows everything you need to know!

Your documents will be processed by the Faculty council and you will receive an email notification once this is done. Your pre-examiners will also receive a formal invitation and the submitted PhD thesis. Now you cross your fingers, wait for two months and hope for positive reviews. Time to think what you will do next in your life and perhaps stat to look for a position in academia or industry!

## Defense (end of year 4)
Your supervisor again selects 1-2 opponents who will come and publicly torture you. You also need to publish your thesis, i.e. make it publicly and openly available. Do the following steps:

 1. Fill the form for the permission to publish the thesis at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)
 2. Write a document describing how did you do the changes requested by the pre-examiners (your supervisor should check them, at least in theory)
 3. Your supervisor fills the form about the defense and suitable opponent(s) at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)

These are sent to the PhD coordinator (Elina for DCEE students). Again the official permission comes from the Faculty council, but meanwhile you already prepare the following:

 - You send the thesis and a separate title page document (tempate at [https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/](https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/) ) to *dissertations ät tuni.fi*
 - You send the title page, thesis and articles (if separate from the thesis PDF) to Punamusta for printing using this form [https://tilaukset.omapumu.com/tampereen_yliopisto/index.php?kielivalinta=englanti](https://tilaukset.omapumu.com/tampereen_yliopisto/index.php?kielivalinta=englanti) - your PhD programme coordinator will tell you the minimum amount to be printed and paid by he faculty. You might want to pay a few more copies for your personal use.

After Faculty council informs you that the permission to publish is granted:
 - **immediately** notify *dissertations ät tuni.fi* to publish the thesis in Trepo (example: [https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/124060](https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/124060))
 - Your supervisor should send the link to the thesis to the opponent(s)
 - **immediately** notify *dissertations ät punamusta.com* to start printing
 - You should send printed books to the opponents as well

### Defense
You are almost done. Next you need just a little bit of marketing and planning.
 - **Press release** use the template at [https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/pressrelease](https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/pressrelease) along with a nice picture of you and send to viestinta.tau ät tuni.fi - typically your supervisor takes care of this
 - Book defense auditorium (if physical defense)
 - Order coffee for the defense (if physical defense)
 - Prepare Zoom meeting (if online) and test everything

### "Karonkka" dinner
This is not an official part of your defense, but expected in Finland. That means that to "thank" your opponents you will take them for a formal table served dinner to some nice place. During Karonkka, typically during the coffee, there are speeches where you thank people who contributed to your successful PhD thesis (semi-official order: opponents, supervisor, co-authors, others) 

## Freedom (years 5-128)

You live a happy life!
