# PhD Thesis
Below are very short instructions for the process and links to the corresponding university Web pages.

## Do the research
This is the most challenging part, but don't worry, your supervisor will tell you as that's his/her job!

## Start writing the thesis
Your supervisor tells you that "Now its time!". What you need is a suitable template. One used by many is provided by Ville Koljonen here: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/zskzfgpnpjcz](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zskzfgpnpjcz)

Once you are done (make sure you do it well), you send a PDF to your supervisor(s) for review and comments. After they are happy to your thesis it is ready for pre-examination.

## Pre-examination
Your supervisor selects two reviewers, makes sure they are available and fills the official form (see below).
You need to send the following two documents

 - The pre-examination form (you supervisor fills) available at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)
 - PhD thesis in PDF format and including the articles (better to make a single PDF file)

to the responsible person of your doctoral program. For Signal Processing and Machine Learning PhD students this is *elina.orava ät tuni.fi* who knows everything you need to know!

Your documents will be processed by the Faculty council and you will receive an email notification once this is done. Your pre-examinors will also receive a formal invitation and the submitted PhD thesis. Now you cross your fingers, wait for two months and hope for positive reviews. Time to think what you will do next and perhaps look for a position in academia or industry!

## Defense
Your supervisor again selects 1-2 opponents and you need to publish your thesis publicly. Do the following steps:

 1. Fill the form for the permission to publish the thesis at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)
 2. Write a document describing how did you do the changes requested by the pre-examiners (your supervisor should check them, at least in theory)
 3. Your supervisor fills the form about the defense and suitable opponent(s) at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)

These are sent to the PhD coordinator (Elina for SPML students). Again the official permission comes from the Faculty council, but meanwhile you already prepare the following:

 - You send the thesis and a separate title page document (tempate at [https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/](https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/) ) to *dissertations ät tuni.fi*
 - You send the title page, thesis and articles (if separate from the thesis PDF) to Punamusta for printing using this form [https://tilaukset.omapumu.com/tampereen_yliopisto/index.php?kielivalinta=englanti](https://tilaukset.omapumu.com/tampereen_yliopisto/index.php?kielivalinta=englanti) - your PhD programme coordinator will tell you the minimum amount to be printed and paid by he faculty. You might want to pay a few more copies for your personal use.
 - After you receive permission from the Faculty Council you **immediately** notify *dissertations ät tuni.fi* that they can publish the thesis (they provide you a permanent link page to university library)
 - You also notify the printing house by mailing dissertations ät punamusta.com
 - The permalink and/or printed books are delivered to your opponents asap

### Defense
Two weeks before the defense you need to do the press release (typically your supervisor is more anxious to do this than you are):

 - Press release template at [https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/pressrelease](https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/pressrelease) along with a nice picture of you is sent to viestinta.tau ät tuni.fi
 - Order coffee if the defense is physical
