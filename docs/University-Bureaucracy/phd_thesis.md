# PhD Thesis
So, you decided that doing a PhD thesis is good for your future. Along the long and winding road you may find the following instructions useful.

## Stage 1 - Do research (years 1-4)

**Input:** 1) you, 2) your supervisor, and 3) funding for your salary and research.

This is the most challenging part, but don't worry, your supervisor will tell you all the necessary details and tricks. However, you may find the following links helpful or at least fun to read:

 - [A Survival Guide to a PhD by Andrej Karpahty](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/09/07/phd/)
 - [How to do research by Bill Freeman](http://people.csail.mit.edu/billf/publications/How_To_Do_Research.pdf)
 - [Scientific article writing by Fredo Durand](http://people.csail.mit.edu/fredo/FredoBadWriting.pdf)

**Output:** Novel scientific knowledge. More concretely, a number of peer-reviewed scientific articles.

## Stage 2 - Write the thesis manuscript (year 4)

**Input:** Sufficient amount of scientific contributions, typically in the terms of the articles from the previous stage.

It is difficult to tell a generic rule when you're reaady to start writing your thesis as that varies a lot between the fields, even between fields close to each other. You should discuss with your supervisor each year what is the stage of your PhD studies and she/he certainly tells you when it is time to start writing.

Before writing you need a suitable template. Vast majority of people prefer Latex as it is just so convenient for writing scientific text.
* A popular template is provided by Ville Koljonen: [https://www.overleaf.com/read/zskzfgpnpjcz](https://www.overleaf.com/read/zskzfgpnpjcz)

**Output:** A thesis manuscript that summarizes your research and results. The thesis can be a monograph or a compilation thesis that includes your original articles. Write using a meaningful structure and beautiful grammar and send it for comments to your supervisor(s) before proceeding to the next stage.

## Stage 3 - Pre-examination

**Input:** Final draft of thesis and fixed using the comments from your supervisor. The pre-examination form.

Your supervisor selects two reviewers, makes sure they are available and willing and fills the official form (see below). You need to send the following two documents to your doctoral program office:

 1. The pre-examination form filled (ask your supervisor to help) available at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)
 2. PhD thesis in PDF format. If a compilation thesis, then it should include the articles. Make a single PDF and if its size >15MB you should downscale your images before compiling the PDF

The documents should be sent to the *Academic officer* of your doctoral program, for example deadlines and officers for the Doctoral program of Computing and Electrical Engineering (CEE) can be found from
* [DPCEE](https://intra.tuni.fi/en/handbook?page=5612)
 
Your documents will be processed by the Faculty council and you will receive an email notification once this is done. Your pre-examiners will also receive a formal invitation and the submitted PhD thesis. Now you cross your fingers, wait for two months and hope for positive reviews. Time to think what you will do next in your life and perhaps stat to look for a position in academia or industry!

**Output:** Faculty council decision for pre-examination. Official invitations to the pre-examiners. 

## Stage 4 - Defense

**Input:** 1) positive statement from the pre-examiners. Form to publish the thesis.

Your supervisor selects 1-2 opponents who will come and publicly "torture" you, i.e. ask nasty questions about your thesis. You also need to publish your thesis, i.e. make it publicly and openly available. Submit the following documents to the Academic Officer of your doctoral program:

 1. The form for the permission to publish the thesis available  at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)
 2. A document describing the changes requested by the pre-examiners (if requested). This document is similar to "Revision letter" where you reply to reviewers' comments if they requested "major revision" for your article. If necessary discuss with your supervisor how to do these. 
 3. The form about the defense and suitable opponent(s) written by your supervisor and available at [https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet](https://wiki.tamk.fi/display/DPCEEO/8.+Lomakkeet+ja+ohjeet)

Again the official permission comes from the Faculty council, but meanwhile you already prepare the following:

 - You send the thesis and a separate title page document (tempate at [https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/](https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/) ) to *dissertations 채t tuni.fi*
 - You send the title page, thesis and articles (if separate from the thesis PDF) to Punamusta for printing using this form [https://tilaukset.omapumu.com/tampereen_yliopisto/index.php?kielivalinta=englanti](https://tilaukset.omapumu.com/tampereen_yliopisto/index.php?kielivalinta=englanti) - your PhD programme coordinator will tell you the minimum amount to be printed and paid by he faculty. You might want to pay a few more copies for your personal use.

After Faculty council informs you that the permission to publish is granted:

 - **immediately** notify *dissertations 채t tuni.fi* to publish the thesis in Trepo (example: [https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/124060](https://trepo.tuni.fi/handle/10024/124060))
 - Your supervisor should send the link to the thesis to the opponent(s)
 - **immediately** notify *dissertations 채t punamusta.com* to start printing
 - You should send printed books to the opponents as well

**Output:** 1) permission for the public defense, 2) public link to your thesis in the library database, 3) printed thesis, 4) press release and 5) public defense.

### Pre-defense - PR
You are almost done. Next you need just a little bit of marketing and planning.

 - **Press release** use the template at [https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/pressrelease](https://libguides.tuni.fi/dissertationpublishing/pressrelease) along with a nice picture of you and send to viestinta.tau 채t tuni.fi - typically your supervisor takes care of this
 - Book defense auditorium (if physical defense)
 - Order coffee for the defense (if physical defense)
 - Prepare Zoom meeting (if online) and test everything

### In-defense - The defense act
This is a formal "act" with pre-defined lyrics for custos, candidate and opponents. More details available at
* [https://intra.tuni.fi/en/handbook?page=4231](https://intra.tuni.fi/en/handbook?page=4231)

### Post-defense -  "Karonkka" dinner
This is not an official part of your defense, but expected in Finland. That means that to "thank" your opponents you will take them for a formal table served dinner to some nice place. During Karonkka, typically during the coffee, there are speeches where you thank people who contributed to your successful PhD thesis (semi-official order: opponents, supervisor, co-authors, others)

## Freedom (years 5-128)

Enjoy your life (finally ;-) !
