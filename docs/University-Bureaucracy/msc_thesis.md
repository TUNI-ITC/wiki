# MSc Thesis
MSc thesis project is the last step of your studies. It is typically six months of full-time coding, building, testing and writing. 

The thesis is about marketing yourself and therefore you should impress yourself, your family, your supervisors and your future employer.

It is advisable to produce Github pages for your code and data with nice Wiki how to replicate the results and link to the thesis PDF. Its even better if the page also contains a Youtube video of your results. 

## Stage 1 - Find a topic
When your studies are almost finished (2nd year of Master studies) you should start looking for a job or intern position where you can do your thesis. This could be your current work, research group in university or a new company you want to work for. You are young so recommendation is that 1) you do something meaningful and difficult, 2) you learn a lot and 3) you impress people you work for.

You could contact your professors and ask them for open topics in their research groups (paid and unpaid positions are available) or if they know any companies who are looking for a master's thesis worker. Be active and search until you find a place who wants you for whom you want to work for.

## Stage 2 - Agree about the topic with your supervisors
**Important:** You need understand what should be done in this thesis! You need to understand why this is an important topic (motivates that it needs to be done)! You must understand how to evaluate the quality of your results (otherwise it will be unclear what is the quality of your work).

You should have two supervisors: 1) Academic supervisor who is a senior staff from university (professor, associate/assistant professor, lecturer etc. someone with doctoral degree) and 2)  a technical supervisor from the company you work for (preferably someone with MSc degree so that they know what MSc thesis is all about). You may interview multiple professors to find who is the most suitable for you. You need help and someone who wants to help you so don't just take anyone.

Company pays your salary so you must make your technical supervisor agree to what you are planning to do, especially if you do the work during your working hours. You also must agree what is confidential and cannot be put to your thesis as MSc theses are always public.

**Concrete action:** Fill and agree the thesis supervision plan with your supervisors. Template here: [enter link description here](https://content-webapi.tuni.fi/proxy/public/2019-06/opas_ykk_ohjaussuunnitelma_fineng.rtf)

## Stage 3 - Do thesis project (~5 months)
**Important:** There are three important things to bear in mind: 1) read what others have done (related work), 2) read what others have done (related work) and finally 3) read what others have done (related work).

Before you can find correct elated works you *must know the correct terminology of your problem*! Only with the correct terms search engines (Google, you.com) can provide correct links to the existing code and articles and books.

 - Find correct terminology (e.g. "face verification" vs. "face recognition" vs. "face detection")
 - Search related works under this terminology - prefer recent works that have been published in good journals and conferences and have been cited by others.
 - Search existing code you can use
 - Search existing data you can use
 - Based on findings revise your topic and thesis plan

Work hard, be diligent and consult your supervisors often! Yes, talking with supervisors is your responsibility, not theirs.

## Stage 4 - Write thesis (~1 month)

This can happen during stage 3, and its good to make notes all the time.

Examples of great theses (although your supervisor may have different examples so ask them):

- Eero Hein√§nen: [trepolink](https://urn.fi/URN:NBN:fi:tty-201810242459)

**Actions:** You must attend MSc thesis seminar course that includes: 1) listening to MSc presentations by others, 2) presenting your work (at least once, agree this with your supervisor who can add your presentation via [budjetti.cs.tut.fi](https://budjetti.cs.tut.fi/)) and 3) participating information literacy training by university Library. All details you may found from the instructor of your seminar.

## Stage 5 - Submitting the thesis
You must ask your academic supervisor comments for your thesis. Some supervisors comment multiple version and some of the only so called *final draft* i.e. the version that you think is pretty much ready. Ask your supervisor(s) what he/she prefers. Remember that you are evaluated every time you send something to your supervisor!

After the supervisors are happy to the current version:
-  Submit thesis to Turnitin originality test (your supervisor's Moodle space) [instructions](https://intra.tuni.fi/en/handbook?page=4613&search=turnitin)
- After the Turnitin  if fine, submit the final version to Trepo and let your supervisor know its there for evaluation [instructions](https://libguides.tuni.fi/theses)

Enjoy your life!
