## Signal Processing and Machine Learning MSc in Technology (Finnish program, 30 cr + thesis)
Similar to our BSc program the MSc program also consists of two mandatory courses (10 cr) and then the student is encouraged to pick one of our three special sub-modules focusing on *Audio*, *Vision* or *Artificial Intelligence*. Since some of these sub-modules contain one shared course that course is moved to elective module.
