# Wireless connections
If you are tired to use your phone as a wifi hotspot you may try one of the university wireless networks.

## TUNI-STAFF
Works in Windows and centrally maintained Linux boxes, but clearly making it available to self-maintained Linux boxes was beyond their skills. Do not try.

## Eduroam
Eduroam provides access in many universities world wide and is also easiest
wireless connection in TUNI premises.

Easiest way to install Eduroam is to download a domain specific installation script 
from [https://cat.eduroam.org/](https://cat.eduroam.org/) . Just follow the instructions and that's it!
