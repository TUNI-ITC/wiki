# TUNI ITC's crowdsourced Wiki

This repo contains the source code for deployment of the crowdsourced wiki for Faculty of Information Technology and Communication Sciences at Tampere University. Here you can contribute new information to tuni-itc.github.io/wiki, change the apperance, fix mistakes, do whatever you want to help yourself and others.

# How to contribute?

## Preferred option
Preffed option is that you write documentation youself once you know how it should be done. It is "whatever" annoying you don't remember after two months anymore or what frequently someone asks.

### 1. Fork the Wiki
Fork means that you make a personal copy of this wiki - note that anyone can do that and it does not mess the main Wiki!

To do that press the top-righ button *fork* - if you don't have Github account yet, you need to make one.

After that you should have the forked repo somewhere, e.g., "https://github.com/<MY_ACCOUNT>/wiki/"

### 2. Clone your fork locally

In terminal type:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/<MY_ACCOUNT>/wiki/
```
and its done!


### 3. add your knowledge, commit, and push it to your fork

You can edit directly through github Web page ("add file" and "edit" button) or do it locally on your computer. You may freely edit an existing file or create new, e.g., "<MY_NEW_KNOWLEDGE>.md". Write the page using the Github Markdown format (see: https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

Commit your changes!

### 4. make pull request
Go to the main Wiki (https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) and press "Pull requests" -> "Create pull request". Select that your presonal "Main" will be merged to the main Wiki "Main". Make the request and someone will review and accept it. That's it!

After several successful commits you will be invited to the Main Wiki team!

## Secondary option (you have no technical skills)

Create an issue describing what you would like to add/change in the current Wiki and someone will do it.
